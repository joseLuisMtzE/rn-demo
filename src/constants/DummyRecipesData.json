Add chopped Broccoli (florets and steams). Remember to leave out a few florets for later use though.Cover with lid, when broccoli is tender, turn heat off. Transfer contents of pot into a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool slightly. Add to the bowl the fresh parsley, Chobani and almond milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture. In batches, puree the soup in a food-processor (maybe someday soon, a Vitamix!) style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes.

      "instructions":"1.Firstly, to cook the shrimp, heat the olive oil in a pan and once hot add the shrimp crushed garlic and chili flakes. It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside. 2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside. 3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily. 4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it.",

Arrange the fillets on a baking rack over a baking pan. Cover the pan with foil and bake on high at 180 C for 45 minutes to one hour. While the chicken is baking, make the satay sauce: Grind the walnuts and the ginger until finely ground but not powdery. Heat the sesame oil in a medium sized pan on high. Add the garlic and allow it to toast. Add the ground walnuts and toast it for a few seconds. Add the soy sauce and the water. Lower the heat and stir. Add the peanut butter, honey and vinegar and stir until slightly reduced.   Adjust the taste to your preference, adding more of a component if desired. When done, remove from heat and place the sauce in a serving bowl. Make the tomato salad: combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Allow to rest until ready to serve. When the juices of the chicken run clear, remove from the oven and place 2-3 chicken fillets on a plate, top it with the satay sauce (be generous) and add the tomato salad on the side. Enjoy.",

      "instructions":"Begin by melting the butter with the oil in a large Dutch oven.  Brown your beef well on all sides. Once all sides are browned, drain off any excess fat in pan (more than a tsp.) and add 1 qt. of stock to pot.  Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer.  Cover pan and simmer gently for until meat is fork tender, ~2 1/2 hours. When beef is finished, transfer it to a large bowl with any juices and let cool until able to handle, then shred it. In the same pot you cooked the beef in, add the bacon and cook just done.  Remove bacon, but leave fat in pan. Add veggies and cook until just beginning to soften. Add shredded beef and reserved bacon back to pot along with herbs. Add 2 qts. stock (or more to just cover) and simmer over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender, ~10 minutes or so. I let it sit, covered for at least an hour to allow the flavors to come together.  Remove herb stems and bay leaves.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper (and salt if needed, depends on the saltiness of the liquid you used, so taste first). To serve, drizzle with a glug of balsamic vinegar and grate some fresh parmesan over the top.  Sprinkle with fresh, chopped herbs and more black pepper, if desired.",

      "instructions":"Peel and mash your plantain till soft. Mix it with the flour, form mini balls and place in the oven to bake for about 20-25 minutes. Please note the plantain mix will still be moist so use a spoon to help form the balls if you are having difficulty with that. Make sure to drizzle oil on the baking sheet so it does not stick to the sheet when it begins to caramelize. If you do not have an oven you can choose to fry the plantain balls as well. I have not tried the frying method but make sure to dab off the excess oil from the plantain.In a separate pot, on very low heat, melt the butter and pour in the sugar, vanilla, milk and water and stir. Leave it on very low heat throughout. Stir once in a while and if you have a candy thermometer, it is ready at 240F. If you do not, the toffee base is ready when it turns light brown like a caramel colour.Dip the plantain balls and swirl and place on a plate to cool. While its still warm, sprinkle your toppings on it. In this case, my toppings were coconut flakes. Serve when it’s cool.",
